## Overview

## Concepts and strategies

- Identify the variables that you want to predict (the outcome) and the variables that you will use to predict it (the predictors).
  - Split the data into a training set and a test set.
  - Integrate variable selection into the model building process.
- Inspect the data to identify potential problems.
- Interrogate the data with model development and validation.
- Interpret the results of the model on validation set.
