### Repositories

Language-dedicated repositories are a great source of data for language research. Below I've included a listing of some of the more commonly used repositories.

```{r pinboard-repos}
read_rds("assets/listings/data_repositories.rds") |>
  kbl(caption = "Data repositories", escape = FALSE) |>
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") |>
  kable_styling()
```

### Corpora and datasets

Below I've included a listing of corpora and datasets that are available for language research. This list is not exhaustive, but includes a few of the more common corpora and datasets used in language research.

```{r pinboard-datasets}
read_rds("assets/listings/data_corpora.rds") |>
  kbl(caption = "Corpora and language datasets", escape = FALSE) |>
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") |>
  kable_styling()
```

### Aggregated listings

The list of data available for language research is constantly growing. I've document very few of the wide variety of resources. In Table \@ref(tab:pinboard-listings) I've included attempts by others to provide a summary of the corpus data and language resources available.

```{r pinboard-listings}
read_rds("assets/listings/data_listings.rds") |>
  kbl(caption = "Aggregated listings of language corpora and datasets", escape = FALSE) |>
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") |>
  kable_styling()
```

## Custom-built

### Application programming interfaces (APIs)

There are many APIs available for accessing language corpora and datasets. Below I've included a few of the R packages that provide access to these resources.

```{r pinboard-apis}
read_rds("assets/listings/data_apis.rds") |>
  kbl(caption = "R Package APIs to language corpora and datasets.)", escape = FALSE) |>
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") |>
  kable_styling()
```

## Other language resources

Data for language research is not limited to (primary) text sources. Other sources may include processed data from previous research; word lists, linguistic features, *etc*.. Alone or in combination with text sources this data can be a rich and viable source of data for a research project.

```{r pinboard-other}
read_rds("assets/listings/data_experimental.rds") |>
  kbl(caption = "Other language resources", escape = FALSE) |>
  column_spec(1, width = "15em") |>
  kable_styling()
```
