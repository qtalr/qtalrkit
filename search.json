(exm-cd-federalist-html-div-subset?) shows result assigned object called fed_divs. Assuming moment solution (exm-cd-federalist-html-div-subset?) way go, can move forward extract paper number, title, author, text div tag fed_divs. can use html_elements() function extract h2 tag, contains paper number, later work p tags, contain title, author, text. already isolated relevant div tags, using fed_divs object can now continue use html_elements() function extract HTML elements within. paper number h2 tag, immediately div tag. can use html_element() function extract single h2 tag div fed_divs, (exm-cd-federalist-html-h2?). result vector contains h2 tag div tag fed_divs, complete HTML tags attributes. can use html_text() function extract text h2 tag, (exm-cd-federalist-html-h2-text?). included str_trim() function stringr package remove potential whitespace text code (exm-cd-federalist-html-h2-text?). result vector paper numbers, can later leverage create new column dataset. Next, can extract p tags fed_divs object. p tags contain title, author, text. noted , first p tag inside div tag contains paper title. Targeting p tag requires use CSS selector, :nth-child(). CSS selector allows us arbitrarily select p tag want order appears. case, want first p tag, can use :nth-child(1). (exm-cd-federalist-html-p-title?) shows result extracting text assigned object called titles. {{< fa medal >}} Dive deeper CSS selectors powerful tool extracting data HTML files. :nth-child() selector just one many. information CSS selectors, see W3Schools CSS Selector Reference. rvest package supports many, CSS selectors. Consult rvest::html_elements() documentation information. get vector length 13, 10. Scanning output can see likely offender 'PUBLIUS.' text. can exclude adding :(:contains(\"PUBLIUS.\")) CSS selector, (exm-cd-federalist-html-p-title-subset?). works, solution 'brittle', meaning potentially overspecific easily break. example, text title happens include 'PUBLIUS.' excluded. Furthermore, extra p tag contains text 'PUBLIUS.' included. can make solution robust looking general solution. One possibility anchor p tags div tag .clearfix class appears directly (>) p tags want, (exm-cd-federalist-html-p-title-subset-2?). Now 10 titles. Moving author, assume use approach changing nth-child argument 3. However, inspecting HTML reveals author always third p tag, sometimes second. consistent, however, author always preceded text 'Author:'. can use :contains() CSS selector select p tag contains text 'Author:'. result (exm-cd-federalist-html-p-author?), now able extract paper number, title author. dataset taking shape, can appreciate (tbl-cd-federalist-html-dataset-preview?). last step extract text paper. contents papers contained p tags follow p tag author. nice able target p tags follow author p tag. However, CSS selector allows us . alternative read p tags div.clearfix tag select p tags follow author p tag. approach requires additional step. need conduct process paper HTML file separate str_which() function identify index p tag contains author. can use str_subset() function select p tags follow author p tag. gets text single paper within single div tag. can wrap function apply div tag. Now can see text looks like first paper. Putting together first HTML file get following. can test first HTML file. try fifth HTML file, just make sure. Now can apply function HTML files. can data checks make sure right number rows columns.","code":"## {html_document} ## <html lang=\"en\"> ## [1] <head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=Edge\">\\n<meta http ... ##

Third, text interleaved annotation scheme. information may readily understandable, various pieces meta-data header, get better understanding information encoded take look README file. file get birds eye view going . short, data includes 1155 telephone conversations two people annotated 42 'DAMSL' dialog act labels. README file refers us doc/manual.august1.html file information scheme. point open doc/manual.august1.html file browser investigation. find 'DAMSL' stands 'Discourse Annotation Markup System Labeling' first characters line conversation text correspond one combination labels utterance. first utterances : utterance also labeled speaker ('' 'B'), speaker turn ('1', '2', '3', etc.), utterance within turn ('utt1', 'utt2', etc.). annotation provided withing utterance, enough get us started conversations. Now turn meta-data header. see information creation file: 'FILENAME', 'TOPIC', 'DATE', etc. doc/manual.august1.html file much say information returned LDC Documentation found information Online Documentation section. poking around documentation discovered meta-data speaker corpus found caller_tab.csv file. tabular file contain column names, caller_doc.txt . inspecting files manually comparing information conversation file noticed 'FILENAME' information contained three pieces useful information delimited underscores _. first information document id (4325), second third correspond speaker number: first speaker (1632) second speaker B (1519). sum, 1155 conversation files. file two parts, header text section, separated line = characters. header section contains 'FILENAME' line document id, ids speaker speaker B. text section annotated DAMSL tags beginning line, followed speaker, turn number, utterance number, utterance text. knowledge hand, set create tidy dataset following column structure:","code":"data/ ├── derived/ └── original/     └── sdac/         ├── README         ├── doc/         ├── sw00utt/         ├── sw01utt/         ├── sw02utt/         ├── sw03utt/         ├── sw04utt/         ├── sw05utt/         ├── sw06utt/         ├── sw07utt/         ├── sw08utt/         ├── sw09utt/         ├── sw10utt/         ├── sw11utt/         ├── sw12utt/         └── sw13utt/ ├── README ├── doc │   └── manual.august1.html ├── sw00utt │   ├── sw_0001_4325.utt │   ├── sw_0002_4330.utt │   ├── sw_0003_4103.utt │   ├── sw_0004_4327.utt │   ├── sw_0005_4646.utt o = \"Other\" qw = \"Wh-Question\" qy^d = \"Declarative Yes-No-Question\" + = \"Segment (multi-utterance)\" *x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*   FILENAME:   4325_1632_1519 TOPIC#:     323 DATE:       920323 TRANSCRIBER:    glp"},{"path":"https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-6.html","id":"tidy-the-data","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Cases: > Semi-structured: SWDA (.utt) files","what":"Tidy the data","title":"Organizing and documenting data","text":"Add idealized structure SWDA dataset begin reading one conversation files R character vector using read_lines() function readr package. isolate vector element contains document speaker ids, use str_detect() stringr package. function takes two arguments, string pattern, returns logical value, TRUE pattern matched FALSE . can use output function, , subset doc character vector return vector element (line) contains digits_digits_digits regular expression. expression combines digit matching operator \\\\d + operator match 1 contiguous digits. separate three groups \\\\d+ underscores _. result \\\\d+_\\\\d+_\\\\d+. {{< fa regular hand-point->}} Tip Regular Expressions powerful pattern matching syntax. used extensively text manipulation see . develop regular expressions, helpful tool allows interactively test pattern matching. stringr package handy function str_view() str_view_all() allow interactive pattern matching. good website practice Regular Expressions RegEx101. can also install regexplain package R get access useful RStudio Addin. next step extract three digit sequences correspond doc_id, speaker_a_id, speaker_b_id. First extract pattern identified str_extract() can break single character vector multiple parts based underscore _. str_split() function takes string pattern use split character vector. return list character vectors. [] introduced lists earlier material (swirl Objects), least. list special object type R. unordered collection objects whose lengths can differ (contrast data frame collection objects whose lengths --hence tabular format). case list length 1, whose sole element character vector length 3 --one element per segment returned split. desired result cases pass multiple character vectors str_split() function want results conflated single character vector blurring distinction individual character vectors. like conflate, flatten list, can use unlist() function. flatten list case, single character vector, assign result doc_speaker_info. doc_speaker_info now character vector length three. subset elements assign meaningful variable names can conveniently use later tidying process. next step isolate text section extracting rest document. noted previously, sequence = separates header section text section. need index point character vector doc line occurs subset doc point end character vector. first find point = sequence occurs. use str_detect() function find pattern looking (contiguous sequence =), pass logical result () function return element index number match. file 31 index doc = sequence occurs. Now important keep mind working single file sdac/ data. need cautious create pattern may matched multiple times another document corpus. =+ pattern match =, ==, ===, etc. implausible believe might = character line one files. update regular expression avoid potential scenario matching sequences three =. case make use curly bracket operators {}. get result file, safeguard bit unlikely find multiple matches ===, ====, etc. 31 index = sequence, want next line start reading text section. increment index 1. index end text simply length doc vector. can use length() function get index. now bookends, speak, text section. extract text subset doc vector indices. text extra whitespace lines blank lines well. cleaning moving forward organize data. get rid whitespace use str_trim() function default remove leading trailing whitespace line. remove blank lines use logical expression subset text vector. text != \"\" means return TRUE lines blank, FALSE . first step towards tidy dataset now combine doc_id element text data frame. data now data frame, time parse text column extract damsl tags, speaker, speaker turn, utterance number, utterance text separate columns. make extensive use regular expressions. aim find consistent pattern distinguishes piece information text given row data$text extract . best way learn regular expressions use . end included link interactive regular expression practice website regex101. Open site copy text 'TEST STRING' field. Now manually type following regular expressions 'REGULAR EXPRESSION' field one--one (separate line). Notice matched type finished typing. can find exactly component parts expression toggling top right icon window hovering mouse relevant parts expression. can now see, regular expressions match damsl tags, speaker speaker turn, utterance number, utterance text. apply expressions data extract information separate columns make use mutate() str_extract() functions. mutate() take data frame create new columns values match extract row data frame str_extract(). Notice str_extract() different str_extract_all(). work mutate() row evaluated turn, therefore need make one match per row data$text. chained steps code , dropping original text column select(-text), overwriting data results. Tip One twist notice regular expressions R require double backslashes (\\\\\\\\) programming environments use single backslash (\\\\). couple things left columns extracted text move finishing tidy dataset. First, need separate speaker_turn column speaker turn_num columns second need remove unwanted characters damsl_tag, utterance_num, utterance_text columns. separate values column two columns use separate() function. takes column separate character vector names new columns create. default values input column separated non-alphanumeric characters. case means . separator. remove unwanted leading trailing whitespace apply str_trim() function. removing characters matching character(s) replace empty string (\"\") str_replace() function. , chained functions together overwritten data results. round tidy dataset single conversation file connect speaker_a_id speaker_b_id speaker B current dataset adding new column speaker_id. case_when() function exactly : allows us map rows speaker value \"\" speaker_a_id rows value \"B\" speaker_b_id. now tidy dataset set create. dataset includes one conversation file! want apply code 1155 conversation files sdac/ corpus. approach create custom function groups code done single file iterative send file corpus function combine results one data frame. custom function extra code print progress message file runs. sanity check run extract_sdac_metadata() function conversation file just working make sure works expected. Looks good! now time create vector paths conversation files. fs::dir_ls() interfaces OS file system return paths files specified directory. also add pattern match conversation files (regexp = \\\\.utt$) accidentally include files corpus. recurse set TRUE means get full path file. o pass conversation file vector paths conversation files iteratively extract_sdac_metadata() function use map(). apply function conversation file return data frame . bind_rows() join resulting data frames rows give us single tidy dataset 1155 conversations.
